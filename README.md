# Virtual-world

This is a fork of the code Radu Mariescu-Istodor wrote during **Phase 2** of the Self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course:

You can also find **Phase 1** here:  
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY  
But **Phase 2** is a standalone project until the end when the 2 code bases merge.

I decided to convert it all to TypeScript excluding the first lesson.

1. Spatial Graphs [not converted]
2. Graph Editor [v1]
3. Dynamic Viewport [v1]
4. Roads [v1]
5. Buildings And Trees [v1 coming Nov 18]
6. Fake 3D [v1 coming Nov 19][No roofs]
7. ... [v1 coming Nov 20][No roofs; without refactoring part]
   .
   .
   .

**Please note that this is me writing Typescript for the first time. Code is not very good, but I am aware of the mistakes and will 
not make most of them in the future projects which was my goal here. However, I will most likely not come back 
to fix DOCUMENTATION and TYPES**

## Planned Features

After the course is completed, I will create a similar scenery in Three.Js. This will be a different repository though!

## Installation
