# Virtual-world

This is a fork of the code Radu Mariescu-Istodor wrote during **Phase 2** of the Self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course:

You can also find **Phase 1** here:

But **Phase 2** is a standalone project until the end when the 2 code bases merge.

I decided to convert it all to TypeScript excluding the first lesson.
