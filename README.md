# Virtual-world

This is a fork of the code Radu Mariescu-Istodor wrote during **Phase 2** of the Self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course:

You can also find **Phase 1** here:

But **Phase 2** is a standalone project until the end when the 2 code bases merge.

I decided to convert it all to TypeScript excluding the first lesson.

1. Spatial Graphs [not converted]
2. Graph Editor
3. Dynamic Viewport
4. Roads
5. Buildings And Trees
6. Fake 3D [No roofs]
7. Markings [No roofs; no refactoring]
8. Saving The World [No roofs; no refactoring]

**Please note that this is me writing Typescript for the first time. Code is not very good, but I am aware of the mistakes and will 
not make most of them in the future projects which was my goal here.**

As a result of that, I failed multiple times to merge codebases with the Car repository and may not continue the project anytime soon.
